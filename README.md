# Michigan State University Data Analytics Final Project

## Topic Selection
For this project, the topic the team selected was one that is current and affects us all. The housing market is one that all team members are interested in, and the status of the market affects the economic state of the country and therefore, every aspect of people's lives. The cost of houses, mortgage rates, household income and debt are some of the factors to be considered. 
<br>
Additionally, the housing market crash of 2008 is an event that no one wants repeated. With inflation and rising gas prices, considering the 2008 crash is vital to this analysis. 

## Questions to Consider and Data Sources
The main question is whether or not the housing market has the potential to crash again. As well as the following questions:

- What trends lead to the 2008 crash? 
- What was done to prevent another crash? 
- What current trends are repeating? 
- How do they line up with 2008 trends? 
- What new trends are prominent?
      
 Questions will be answered using data sourced from: 
 
 - https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx

 - https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=fhfa

 - https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/household_debt/state/map/#year:2020

### Protocols
- Description of communication Protocols: Slack and zoom meetings.
   
### Outline
- Will be using answering questions stated in first segment using HPI information, market research, and household debt from the past 20 years. 
    
- Datasets were extracted and cleaned from various goverment websites.
Pandas was used to remove any data that had missing rows or were not necessary. Next Data was organized per years so we could start analyzing the data. A table was created for every year to see HPI and household debt. 

Sample of code in SQL is seen below.

- Machine Learning steps are currently taking place to start analyzing the data that was collected. To compare the trends throughout the years and what lead to previous falls and what trends are currently going on now.
