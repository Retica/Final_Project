# Final_Project
## First Segment Deliverable 

### Overview
<!--Project Overview: This info should be in the README.md -->
### Overview
* Selected topic: Analysis of house market crash in 2008 and current trends. We will look at the trends from 2008 and compare them to current trends. <br>
* Reason they selected the topic: Our group has members who would like to buy homes in the near future . With  home prices rising drastically, we want to investigate if there will be a house market crash that was similar to 2008. <br>
* Description of the source of data: The data was sourced from     
      

        https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx

        https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=fhfa

  <br>
* Questions they hope to answer with the data: Will we have another crash in the near future making home buying more affordable? Will home prices drop at the same rate as it did in 2008? What new trends are prominent? Our analysis will help determine the answers to these questions.

- Datasets were extracted and cleaned from various goverment websites.
Pandas was used to remove any data that had missing rows or were not necessary. Next Data was organized per years so we could start analyzing the data. A table was created for every year to see HPI and household debt.
